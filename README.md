# Heart-Disease-Binary-Classification
Python Libraries Used: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and os. |
Description: Used Linear Regression to predict whether a patient suffers from a heart disease with an accuracy of 95%. Used feature engineering to deal with missing data using Imputation, OnHotEncoding etc. Evaluated the model using different metrics like Accuracy, Confusion matrix, Precision, Recall, F1 score and also by plotting ROC curve. Making use of RandomSearchCV and GridSearchCV to tune the hyper-parameters of our model. Using a correlation matrix to decode the most significant feature variables. |
